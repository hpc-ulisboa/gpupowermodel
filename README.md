# gpmTOOL - GPU Power Modelling Tool

## 1. DESCRIPTION

``gpmTOOL`` is a command line tool for modelling the power consumption of a GPU device. The tool implements the iterative heuristic algorithm proposed in [1] and [2], initially presented in [HPCA'2018](https://youtu.be/ppsPx6zaC0U), to determine the unknown characteristics of GPU devices in order to estimate the GPU power consumption across an ample range of frequency and voltage configurations for the multiple GPU frequency domains.

By providing an input file with details of the execution of different applications on a specific GPU device, the tool is able to model the characteristics of the different architecture components. The tool can also estimate how the cores voltage scales with their frequency. From the resulting model it is possible to estimate the power consumption of any new application for different frequency configurations, by providing the utilization of the modelled GPU components.

To get more information of how to install or use it, you should keep reading this file.
